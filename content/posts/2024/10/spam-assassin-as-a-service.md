Hello world!

In this post I'm sharing a fun project I had to deliver for a much larger project: A Spam identifier available as an API.

## What are the requirements?

The span detector that I was tasked to create is part of a much larger system. Basically, the need is to test if the email content can be assymiled as a spam, before sending the email.

The #1 open source solution for spam detection is Spam Assassin. The question then is to make Spam Assassin available as an API.

## Take away
